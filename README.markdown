# smate
## A Ruby port of the smate script originally written in Perl

Original script found at [http://www.sergeant.org/smate](http://www.sergeant.org/smate) and written by Matt Sergeant.

Just started, but figured this would be a good learning project. Will allow you open a file over ssh / sftp and work on it locally in textmate, where changes will be watched and each time you save the file will be uploaded.
